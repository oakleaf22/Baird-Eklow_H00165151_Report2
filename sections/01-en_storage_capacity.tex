\section{Question 1}



Before we can calculate the energy storage capacity that Scotland requires to satisfy its electricity demand at all times with renewable generation, we need to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determine Scotland's current typical electricity demand
	\item Upscale the current generation mix for renewable technologies
	\item Calculate the necessary power storage capacity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typical electricity demand}

The Department for Business, Energy {\&} Industrial Strategy (BEIS) of the UK Government publishes electricity generation and supply statistics on a quarterly basis \citep{BEIS2018ElecUK}.
Table~\ref{tbl:elec_demand} presents the most up-to-date figures for Scotland.
England is a regular importer of electricity from Scotland \citep{BEIS2018EnergyTrends}.
Northern Ireland usually imports electricity from Scotland but was a net exporter to Scotland for the first time in 2016, which continued in 2017 \citep{BEIS2018EnergyTrends}.
Scotland's annual demand is calculated by subtracting the exported electricity from and adding the imported electricity to its total generation.
This gives Scotland a current typical electricity demand of 35,810~GWh.

\subsection{Upscale of renewable generation mix}

Tables~\ref{tbl:installed_cap}, \ref{tbl:RE_gen} and \ref{tbl:days} respectively present the installed capacity of renewable technologies in Scotland, the renewable generation in Scotland and the number of days per year from 2012 or 2013 to 2017.
Equation~\ref{eq:CF} represents the annual capacity factor (CF), i.e. the ratio of annual energy yield over the maximum possible annual energy yield.
The capacity factors for Scotland's renewable technologies were calculated per year by inputting the data in the aforementioned tables in Equation~\ref{eq:CF}.
Equation~\ref{eq:CF_example} demonstrates this with the calculation of the capacity factor for onshore wind energy in 2013.
The capacity factors and their averages are presented in Table~\ref{tbl:CFs}.

\input{tables/Installed_capacity}

\input{tables/RE_generation}

\input{tables/Days_in_a_year}

\input{tables/CFs}

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:CF}
		\begin{split}
			CF & = \frac{annual\;energy\;yield\;[MWh]}{maximum\;possible\;energy\;yield\;[MWh]} \\
			& \\
			& = \frac{generation\;[MWh]}{average\;capacity\;[MW] \times hours\;in\;the\;year\;[h]}
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:CF_example}
		\begin{split}
			CF_{onshore\;wind,\;2013} & = \frac{2013\;generation\;[GWh] \times 1000}{\frac{2012\;capacity\;+\;2013\;capacity}{2}\;[MW] \times 24\;[h] \times days\;in\;2013} \\
			& \\
			& = \frac{10,563\;[GWh] \times 1000}{\frac{3,765\;+\;4,589}{2}\;[MW] \times 24\;[h] \times 365} = \frac{10,563,000\;[MWh]}{4,177\;[MW] \times 8,760\;[h]} \\
			& \\
			& = 29\%
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}

Using the average capacity factors and the cumulative installed capacity of renewable technologies from 2017, we can calculate the typical RE generation in Scotland (see Table~\ref{tbl:upscale}).
This is calculated by re-arranging Equation~\ref{eq:CF} for generation.
It was found that, currently, Scotland's RE generation typically meets 73.4\% of its electricity demand of 35,810~GWh.
By upscaling the 2017 cumulative installed capacity by 36.4\%, the subsequent RE generation can meet 100\% of Scotland's demand.

\subsection{Power storage capacity}

\textbf{intro}



\subsubsection{Peak power demand}

Since we were unable to find Scotland's peak power demand, we deduced it from the overall UK demand.
The UK's peak power demand in 2017 was 52.279~GW \citep{BEIS2018PeakDemand}.
And in 2017, Scotland's population accounted for 8.2\% of the total UK population \citep{OfficeforNationalStatistics2018}.
Therefore, we can assume that Scotland's peak power demand is 8.2\% of the UK demand, i.e. 4.29~GW.

However, this demand does not account for losses in transmission etc.
To find the losses, we subtracted Scotland's total electricity consumption in 2017 of 30,590~GWh \citep{BEIS2018ElecUK} from Scotland's annual electricity demand of 35,810~GWh.
The losses, 5,220~GWh, represent 15\% of the annual energy demand.
Therefore, we scaled up Scotland's peak power demand by 15\% to account for losses; this results in 4.91~GW.


\subsubsection{Base load}

For the base load we include all dispatchable loads that can be turned on and off at any given time.
This will consist of 116~MW of landfill gas, 7~MW of sewage sludge digestion, and 295~MW of other biomass (see Table~\ref{tbl:installed_cap}).
Large scale hydro can also be considered dispatchable, but its load will depend on precipitation which varies largely by season.
Figure~\ref{fig:hydro_distribution} shows that hydro in the UK has an average capacity factor of 50\% in the winter, which we can assume coincides with Scotland's peak electricity demand due to the increased need for lighting and heating.
(However, it should be noted that there might be slight discrepancies between hydro's capacity factors in the UK and Scotland.)
Therefore, we consider the base load to also consist of 50\% of the installed capacity for large scale hydro, i.e. 50\% of 1,341~MW which equals 670.5~MW (see Table~\ref{tbl:installed_cap}).
In total, the base load amounts to 1.48~GW.

\input{figures/Hydro_distribution}


\subsubsection{Necessary power storage capacity}

Scotland's necessary power storage capacity can then simply be calculated as the difference between its peak power demand (including losses) and base load, i.e. $4.91~GW - 1.48~GW = 3.43~GW$.
