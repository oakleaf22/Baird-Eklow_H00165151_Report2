\section{Question 1}

\textit{\textbf{AIM: Calculate the energy storage capacity Scotland would need to satisfy all its electricity needs with renewable generation and provide a stable grid.}}

According to Scottish Government's quote in assignment description, Scotland's typical electricity demand is 15-16 GW.
\hl{Is this the current typical electricity demand?}

As of Q3 2018, the total installed capacity of renewable energy in Scotland is $10,475 MW$ (see Figure \ref{fig:installed_capacity}), i.e. almost $10.5 GW$ which is two-thirds of Scotland's electricity demand.
\hl{QUESTION: Is all of this RE electricity or is some heat?}
Scotland will thus need to install another $5-6 GW$ of renewable energy capacity to meet the demand.

\hl{QUESTION: Energy capacity = energy storage? Does storage change between renewable technologies?}
